Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</br>
Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</br>
Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</br>
Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</br>
Stay home if you feel unwell.</br>
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</br>
Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. </br>This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</br>
Masks is compulsory </br>
Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others.</br> Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.</br> Follow the advice provided by your local health authority</br>
